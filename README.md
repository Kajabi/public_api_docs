# Kajabi Public API Documentation

This repository contains the source files for [developers.kajabi.com](https://developers.kajabi.com), Kajabi's public API documentation site built with Mintlify.

**[See Mintlify quickstart guide](https://starter.mintlify.com/quickstart)**

```

### Key Files

- **`openapi.yaml`**: The OpenAPI specification that Mintlify uses to auto-generate API endpoint documentation. This file is automatically generated from the main Kajabi application and should not be edited directly in this repository.

- **`docs.json`**: The main configuration file that controls:
  - Site theme and appearance (colors, fonts, layout)
  - Navigation structure (tabs, groups, pages)
  - Branding (logos, favicon)
  - External links (status page, feedback form, login)
  - Contextual features (copy, AI integrations)

- **`api-reference/`**: Custom MDX pages for introductory content that appears alongside the auto-generated API reference.

- **`changelog.mdx`**: Manually maintained changelog documenting API updates and changes.

## Local Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally:

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```bash
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`. If port 3000 is already in use, the site will run on the next available port (e.g., 3001).

### Testing Changes

Before committing changes, always:
1. Run `mint dev` to preview changes locally
2. Check that navigation works correctly
3. Verify all links are functional
4. Review the changelog if you've added entries
5. Test on both light and dark modes if you've changed styling

## Configuration

### Updating Site Theme

The site uses the "aspen" theme with custom Kajabi branding. To modify colors, fonts, or theme settings, edit `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "aspen",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#ff757a",
    "light": "#fe7279",
    "dark": "#ff757a"
  }
}
```

### Custom Fonts

The site uses two custom Kajabi fonts:
- **Faire Sprig** (body text)
- **Greet** (headings)

Both fonts are hosted on Kajabi's CDN and configured in `docs.json`.

### Navigation Structure

Navigation is organized into tabs defined in `docs.json`:
- **API Documentation tab**: Contains the auto-generated API reference and custom intro pages
- **Changelog tab**: Displays the API changelog

To modify navigation:
1. Open `docs.json`
2. Edit the `navigation.tabs` array
3. Add/remove pages or groups as needed
4. Test locally with `mint dev`

### Updating Branding

To update logos or favicon:
1. Replace the files in `/logo/` or root directory
2. Keep the same filenames, or update references in `docs.json`
3. Ensure logos work well on both light and dark backgrounds

### External Integrations

The site includes several integrated links configured in `docs.json`:
- **Status page**: Links to https://status.kajabi.com/
- **Feedback form**: Typeform for user feedback (https://kajabi.typeform.com/to/CO8xXiGz)
- **Login link**: Direct link to Kajabi app login
- **Contextual integrations**: Copy, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, MCP, Cursor, VSCode

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Documentation Page

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `api-reference/new-page.mdx`)
2. Add frontmatter if needed (title, description, etc.)
3. Update `docs.json` to include the new page in the navigation structure
4. Test locally with `mint dev`
5. Commit and push to deploy

### Updating the Changelog

1. Edit `changelog.mdx`
2. Add new entries at the top with dates
3. Follow the existing format for consistency
4. Test locally to ensure formatting is correct
5. Commit and push to deploy

## Publishing Changes

### Automatic Deployment

This repository is connected to Mintlify via the [GitHub App](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

**Changes are automatically deployed to production when pushed to the `main` branch.**

### Deployment Process

1. Create a feature branch for your changes
2. Make and test your changes locally
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. After review and approval, merge to `main`
5. Mintlify automatically detects the change and deploys within minutes
6. Verify changes at https://developers.kajabi.com

### Accessing the Dashboard

Visit the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to:
- View deployment status and logs
- Configure GitHub integration settings
- Manage team access
- View analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Dev Environment Issues

- **Dev environment isn't running**: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI
- **Page loads as 404**: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`
- **Port conflicts**: If port 3000 is in use, Mintlify will automatically use the next available port
- **Changes not reflecting**: Clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### Configuration Issues

- **Navigation not appearing**: Check that your `docs.json` syntax is valid (use a JSON validator)
- **Custom fonts not loading**: Verify the font URLs are accessible and the format is correct
- **Broken links**: Ensure all page references in `docs.json` match actual file paths (without `.mdx` extension)

### Build/Deployment Issues

- **Changes not deploying**: Check the Mintlify dashboard for deployment logs and errors
- **OpenAPI changes not reflected**: The `openapi.yaml` file is generated from the main app; updates happen through that process
